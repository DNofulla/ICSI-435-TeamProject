# To Run The Program

To install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` \
To run training: `python a3c.py --train --savepath 'model_a3c/'` \
To run testing: `python a3c.py --test --loadpath 'model_a3c/'`

Model is located in model_a3c. If you decide to train your own model and test with that instead, please just chance the --savepath and --loadpath directories in the commands above to do so.
